# AoC_23
Had to create a new one ...

Day 1: I'm sooooo in love with RegEx right now <3

Day 2: Added another solution using RegEx 'cause I love it too much now <3

Day 3: 15 minutes for writing codes and 150 for debugging...

Day 4: I guess the puzzle tmr will make me feel stupid again

Day 5: How long do I have to debug the stupid part 2 ... -> spent the whole day debugging and failing only to find the bug after 5 minutes on the very next day (๑•ૅㅁ•๑)

Day 6: I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster right now

Day 7: I finally learned how to play poker

Day 8: Friendly reminder for future me: READ THE PUZZLE BEFORE WRITING THE CODE

Day 9: I'm still very confused even though my code worked (:3 」∠)
